## How to Build
**Requirements:**
- cmake 3.2 or higer https://cmake.org/ 
- SDL2 Development library ( https://www.libsdl.org/ ) 

1. Create a directory called "build"
2. Open cmake-gui and set root directory of a project as a source directory, and "build" directory as, you've guessed it, build directory. 
3. Open cmake-gui and specify SDL2_PATH (it's a hint for Cmake where it should search for SDL2) and SDL2_DLL (it's a path to SD2.dll)
4. run Cmake

If everything went well you should have a project for IDE of your choice
